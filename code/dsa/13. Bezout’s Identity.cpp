gcd(a, b) = g → there exist x, y such that ax + by = g All integers of the form ax + by are exactly the multiples of g.Adding or subtracting multiples doesn’t change gcd a≡b(mod g)⟺g∣(a−b) If gcd(a, b) = 1 ⇒ any integer can be formed If gcd(a, b) = g ⇒ any multiple of g can be formed gcd(a, b) = gcd(a−b, b) = gcd(a, b−a) If gcd(a, b) = g ⇒ gcd(a / g, b / g) = 1 gcd(ka, kb) = kgcd(a, b) If gcd(𝑎, 𝑚) = 1, then Bézout gives ax + my = 1 ⇒ ax≡1(mod m), so x is the modular inverse of a mod m.(Important when mod is needed and m is not prime)
